# The dissipation integrand of the local energy inequality

The local energy inequality of `def:sws` carries an integrability side
condition on its left-hand side: the Dirichlet density `spatialGradientSq u Du`
multiplied by the test function must be integrable on the closed support of
that test function.

This file proves that side condition from the data clauses alone.  The closed
support is compact, so the Dirichlet density is already integrable there
(`CKN.spatialGradientSq_integrableOn_compact_of_data`), and the test function
is a bounded factor.  Nothing about the identities of `def:sws` is used, so the
conclusion is available while those identities are still being established.
