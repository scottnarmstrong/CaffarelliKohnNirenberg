# Supports of space-time test functions

The integrability clauses of `def:sws` are stated on `tsupport φ` viewed as a
subset of the parabolic space-time, while the test-function class
`CKN.spaceTimeTestFunction` states its own support condition on the ordinary product
`Vec3 × ℝ`.  The two closed supports are the same set, but they are produced by
two different topology instances, so a proof has to move between them
explicitly; `CKN.tsupport_parabolic_eq` is the bridge, and this file packages
the consequences that every clause lemma needs:

* the closed support is compact and lies inside the space-time carrier;
* Lebesgue measure restricted to a compact set is finite, which is what turns
  every exponent-lowering step into an application of Hölder's inequality;
* the first and second spatial derivatives and the time derivative of a test
  function again have compact support inside that of the test function, are
  smooth, and are therefore bounded.

Boundedness is the form in which the test function enters: an integrand of
`def:sws` is an integrable field times a bounded factor coming from the test
function.

space and time factors: the identity is a homeomorphism between the two. -/
