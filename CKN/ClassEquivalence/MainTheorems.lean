# The three main theorems under the manuscript's hypothesis

Definition `def:sws` of the manuscript asks four things of a suitable weak
solution: the regularity class (S1), the divergence-free identity (S2), the
weak momentum identity (S3) and the local energy inequality (S4).  It attaches
no integrability side condition to (S2), (S3) or (S4); the integrals appearing
there are simply asserted to vanish, or to satisfy an inequality.
`CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolution` of `CKN/Statements/SuitableWeakSolution.lean`
transcribes that definition literally, and it is the hypothesis of the
statements of Theorems A, B and C.

The Lean class `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable` states the same four conditions but
carries, inside its (S2), (S3) and (S4) clauses, four `IntegrableOn`
conjuncts - one for the divergence-free integrand, one for the momentum
integrand, and one for each side of the local energy inequality.  They were
recorded there because the Bochner integral of a non-integrable function is `0`
by convention: an identity `∫ ... = 0` read off a non-integrable integrand is
true for the wrong reason, and a class that allowed that would be weaker than
the manuscript's.

Those four conjuncts are not extra assumptions.  The files
`CKN/ClassEquivalence/*.lean` derive each of them from the (S1) clauses alone,
and `CKN.isSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable_iff_identities` assembles that derivation into
an equivalence.  So the class with the side conditions and the class without
them have exactly the same inhabitants; `CKN.isSuitableWeakSolution_iff_integrable`
records the identification.

The three theorems that follow are Theorem A, Theorem B and Theorem C under the
manuscript's hypothesis.  Each is the corresponding implementation export of
`CKN/Main/TheoremA.lean`, `CKN/Main/TheoremB.lean` and `CKN/Main/TheoremC.lean`,
whose hypothesis is `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable`, composed with the equivalence;
the conclusions are copied unchanged.  `CKN/Main/TheoremAPaper.lean`,
`CKN/Main/TheoremBPaper.lean` and `CKN/Main/TheoremCPaper.lean` re-export them,
and the statements are short assemblies of those re-exports.

Both forms of the class therefore exist, and both are wanted.  The development
proves its intermediate results with `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable`, which keeps
the integrability of each tested integrand visible at the point of use.  The
statements assume `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolution`: exactly what
`def:sws` assumes, and nothing more.

/-- The manuscript's suitable weak-solution class and the class carrying the
integrability side conditions have the same inhabitants.  Read from left to
right this is the content of `CKN/ClassEquivalence`: the four `IntegrableOn`
conjuncts of `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable` follow from the (S1) clauses, so
assuming them assumes nothing beyond `def:sws`.  Read from right to left it is
the projection that discards them.

The two classes group their clauses differently - `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable`
and `CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolution` both write the (S1) clauses inline, while
`CKN.isSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable_iff_identities` collects them into
`CKN.IsSuitableWeakSolutionData` - so each direction re-associates the
conjunction before handing it on.  No identity is read at a junk value of the
Bochner integral: the left-to-right direction goes through
`CKN.isSuitableWeakSolutionIntegrable_of_identities`, which establishes the four
integrability clauses from the (S1) clauses before consuming any identity. -/
