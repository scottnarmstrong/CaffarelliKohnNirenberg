# The integrand of the divergence-free identity

The divergence-free clause of `def:sws` pairs the identity
`∫ ∑ᵢ uᵢ ∂ᵢψ = 0` with an integrability side condition on the integrand, stated
on the closed support of the test function `ψ`.

This file proves that side condition from the data clauses alone.  The closed
support is compact, so Lebesgue measure restricted to it is finite and the
square integrable velocity of the data clauses is integrable there; each
spatial derivative of a test function is a bounded factor, and the integrand is
a finite sum of such products.

Nothing about the identities of `def:sws` is used, so the conclusion is
available while those identities are still being established.
