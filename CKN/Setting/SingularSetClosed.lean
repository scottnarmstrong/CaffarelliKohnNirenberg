# Relative closedness of the singular set

Paper label `lem:S-closed`: for a suitable weak solution on the space-time
carrier `𝒪 = Ω × I`, the singular set is relatively closed in `𝒪`.  The proof
is the paper's: the regular points form an open set, because the open
neighbourhood that witnesses regularity at one point witnesses it at every
point of that same neighbourhood; the singular set is then the trace on `𝒪`
of the complement, a closed set.
