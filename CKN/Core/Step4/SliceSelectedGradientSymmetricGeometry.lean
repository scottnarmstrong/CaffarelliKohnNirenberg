/-! # Geometry of the symmetric parabolic window

Display `eq:parabolic-ball` of `paper/ckn.tex` presents the parabolic ball of
radius `R` about `z₀ = (x₀, t₀)` as the product of the spatial Euclidean ball
`B_R(x₀)` with the symmetric time interval `(t₀ - R², t₀ + R²)`, written
`𝔅_R(z₀)`.

This file records the elementary spatial facts needed to rewrite membership
between the one-sided and symmetric carriers: the explicit round ball
`euclideanBall` is the norm ball `vec3Ball`, and the closure of a smaller norm
ball lies inside any larger one, so the boundary of an inner carrier is
absorbed by the slightly larger open window used in display (3.5).

The module contains no analytic content: it is pure parabolic geometry, and its
statements are used only to rewrite membership between the one-sided and
symmetric carriers. -/

/-- The explicit round ball `euclideanBall x₀ r` of `CKN/Foundation/Sobolev` and
the norm ball `vec3Ball x₀ r` of `CKN/Foundation/Parabolic` describe the same
subset of `Vec3` whenever `r > 0`, because both are cut out by the strict
inequality `vecEuclideanNorm (x - x₀) < r`. -/

/-- The closed ball of radius `r` is contained in the open ball of any larger
radius `s`, so the closure of `vec3Ball x r` is a subset of `vec3Ball x s` when

slightly larger open window used in display (3.5). -/
