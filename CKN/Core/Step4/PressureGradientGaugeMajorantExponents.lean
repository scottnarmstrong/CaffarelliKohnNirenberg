# Radius exponents for the pressure term of a slice majorant

The pressure-gradient slice estimate of `ss:step3` carries, on a cell of
radius `r` and at doubled spatial radius `ρ = 2 r`, the positive term
`ρ⁻¹ᐟ² ‖p(·,s)‖_{L^{3/2}(B_ρ)}`.  Raising it to the power `6/5` and
integrating over the backward window `(t - r², t]` produces a power of `r`
that has to dominate the power `5 - 6/κ` demanded by membership of the
gradient in the parabolic Morrey class `M^{6/5,κ}` of `def:parabolic-morrey`.

This file records the two exponent balances involved, in the normalisation
`5 * (1 - (6/5)/κ) = 5 - 6/κ`:

* the *cell-centred* route, in which the pressure is replaced by the
  cell-mean-subtracted pressure and controlled in a parabolic Morrey class
  `M^{3/2,χ}` on the doubled cell.  Hölder in time and the Morrey growth then
  give the radius power `19/5 - 6/χ`, so the route closes exactly when
  `1/χ ≤ 1/κ - 1/5`.  The gradient exponent in
  `eq:pressure-gradient-morrey` lies between `25/11` and `25/9`; the
  required pressure exponent ranges from `25/6` to `25/4` at those endpoints.
  Thus `χ ≥ 25/4` suffices uniformly over the admissible range.
* the *fixed-scale* route, in which the pressure enters only through a
  majorant that is bounded in space on a fixed carrier and lies in `L^{3/2}`
  in time, as for the fixed-carrier remainder in the proof of
  `lem:pressure-gradient-morrey`.  The spatial
  measure of the cell then contributes and the radius power is `17/5`, which
  dominates the requirement for every admissible `κ` with room to spare.
