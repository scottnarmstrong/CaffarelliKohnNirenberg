# Support and almost-everywhere stability of weak partial derivatives

Three elementary facts used when weak derivatives produced on small sets are
combined on a larger one: a weak derivative may be replaced by any function
equal to it almost everywhere on the domain; the product of a locally
integrable function with a compactly supported continuous function is
integrable on the domain; and a set integral of a function supported in a
common subset does not see the ambient set.
