# The scale cost of measuring the one-sided constant at the margin

The one-sided transfer constant `oneSidedMorreyBound` is built from a
small-cell bound and a whole-carrier integral bound. This file isolates
the exact cost of measuring the meeting point of the two regimes at the
margin scale `ρ₀` rather than at the carrier radius `ρ₁`: the small-cell
constant `A` is untouched, while the whole-carrier constant `B` carries
the explicit scale ratio `(ρ₁ / ρ₀) ^ (5 * (1 - P / τ))`. The second
statement is the form in which a comparison against an explicit majorant
stated at the carrier radius is transported down to the margin scale.

/-- Measuring the one-sided transfer constant at a smaller scale `ρ₀` is
exactly the same as measuring it at `ρ₁` with the whole-carrier constant `B`
inflated by the explicit ratio `(ρ₁ / ρ₀) ^ (5 * (1 - P / τ))`; the small-cell
constant is untouched. -/
