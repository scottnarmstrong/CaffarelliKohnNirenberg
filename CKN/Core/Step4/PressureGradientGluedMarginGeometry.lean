# Margin-safe parabolic cylinders and their closures

This file records the elementary geometry behind the "doubling with a margin"
step: a parabolic cylinder that meets the carrier region and whose radius is at
most one third of the margin separating the carrier from the outer ball has its
doubled-radius cylinder, and hence the closure of that cylinder, contained in
the outer region.  This is what lets a slice estimate proved at a single cell
radius be applied at twice that radius, at the price of a third of the gap
between the inner and outer regions.

The results are stated in the two settings used later: a one-sided cylinder
based at the origin of the unit parabolic cylinder, and a parabolic metric ball
about an arbitrary centre.

/-- Two Euclidean balls that meet are closer than the sum of their radii: if some
point lies within radius `r` of `x` and within radius `a` of `c`, then the centres
themselves are less than `a + r` apart.  This is the quantitative form of the
separation between a cell that meets the carrier and the outer ball. -/

/-- A parabolic cylinder that meets the carrier at a radius at most a third of the
margin between the carrier and the outer ball has its DOUBLED cylinder inside the
outer region.  Concretely, if `x` is within `R₁ + r` of the origin, `3 * r ≤ R₀ - R₁`
and `R₀ ≤ 1`, then every point of `parabolicCylinder x t (2 * r)` lies in the unit
cylinder `parabolicCylinder 0 0 1`, provided the base time `t` lies below zero and
the doubled time-depth stays at or above the unit depth.  The factor three is the
margin that absorbs the doubling of the radius. -/

/-- The closure form of the margin-safe doubling: if the closure of the unit
parabolic cylinder lies in the space-time carrier `Ω × I`, then so does the closure
of every doubled cylinder whose radius is at most a third of the margin and whose
base point lies within `R₁ + r` of the origin, with the same time-side bounds.  The
closure is taken because the slice estimate is applied on closed one-sided
cylinders. -/
