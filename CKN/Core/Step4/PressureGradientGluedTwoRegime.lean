# The every-cell growth bound in its two regimes

A cell of the pressure-gradient carrier is controlled by the slice estimate at
its own scale only when its ball still fits inside the carrier at that scale;
a cell that is large relative to its distance to the carrier boundary is not
reached by the slice estimate at all.  The growth bound `A · r ^ (5 (1 - P/κ))`
of the parabolic Morrey class therefore has two regimes.

Below a fixed scale `r₀` the bound is the slice bound at the cell's own radius.
At or above `r₀` the cell power integral is bounded by the whole-carrier
integral, and because the growth exponent `5 (1 - P/κ)` is nonnegative for
`P ≤ κ`, that constant bound is itself of the required form, at the cost of the
explicit scale factor `r₀ ^ (-(5 (1 - P/κ)))`.

The two regimes are combined here into a single every-cell statement whose
constant is the sum of the two.  Attempting one uniform argument across all
radii is what makes a growth clause unsatisfiable.
