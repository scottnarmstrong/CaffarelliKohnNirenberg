# The every-cell bound of the origin carrier, at the margin scale

The origin-carrier cell output asks for a bound on **every** Morrey cell of the
selected pressure gradient, at every centre and every positive radius.  The
one-sided transfer supplies it from two inputs: a growth bound on cells below a
fixed scale `ρ₀`, and the total integral on the carrier cylinder.  The scale
`ρ₀` is a free parameter of that transfer, and choosing it is exactly the choice
of where the two regimes meet.

Choosing `ρ₀ = R₁`, the radius of the carrier itself, makes the small-cell input
impossible to supply, for two independent reasons.

* In time, a cell centred at `z` with `z.2 ∈ Ioc (-(3/4) ^ 2) 0` and radius up
  to `R₁ < 3/4` has window `Ioc (z.2 - R₁ ^ 2) z.2`, which reaches below
  `-9/16 - R₁ ^ 2` and hence below `-1`.  Nothing in the hypotheses of the
  estimate controls the solution before time `-1`.
* In space, the slice estimate at a cell of radius `r` is applied on a cylinder
  of radius `2 * r`, and for `r` comparable with `R₁` that doubled ball leaves
  the ball of radius `R₀` on which the pressure slice data lives.

Choosing instead the **margin scale** `ρ₀ = (1 - R₁) / 4` removes both.  The
region the domain hypothesis controls is the closed unit cylinder, so the
governing margin is the one between the carrier radius `R₁` and `1`, not the one
between `R₁` and `R₀`.  At that scale `3 * r ≤ 1 - R₁`, so a cell meeting the
carrier has its doubled ball inside the unit ball; and `r ≤ 1/4`, so
`(2 * r) ^ 2 ≤ 1/4` and every doubled window stays inside `Ioc (-1) 0`.  Cells at
or above the margin scale are not reached by the slice estimate at all and are
bounded by the total integral on the carrier, with the explicit scale factor that
the one-sided transfer constant carries.

The margin scale must not be allowed to degenerate.  Because `R₁ < 3/4`, the
scale `(1 - R₁) / 4` lies in `[1/16, 1/4)`, bounded away from zero uniformly in
the admissible data.  A scale proportional to `R₀ - R₁` would not be: by
`oneSidedMorreyBound_scale_eq`, measuring the transfer constant at a scale `ρ₀`
instead of at `R₁` inflates the whole-carrier constant by exactly
`(R₁ / ρ₀) ^ (5 (1 - (6/5)/κ))`, and with `ρ₀ = (R₀ - R₁) / 3` that factor is
unbounded as `R₁ ↑ R₀`, which would make the comparison with the explicit
majorant of the estimate unsatisfiable at the top of the admissible range.  At
`ρ₀ = (1 - R₁) / 4` the factor is at most `12 ^ (5 (1 - (6/5)/κ))`.

Nothing else in the estimate changes: the transfer, the carrier, the field and
the conclusion are the established ones.
