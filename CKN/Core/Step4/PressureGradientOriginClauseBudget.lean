# Budget comparison for the one-sided pressure-gradient constant

The quantitative constant `oneSidedPressureGradientKP` is the one-sided
Morrey constant of a selected pressure gradient, evaluated with the two
numerical budgets fed to it by the local estimates.  This module records the
elementary comparison facts for that constant: monotonicity of the one-sided
Morrey bound in its two integral budgets, and the resulting bound of the
specialized constant by the general one with the budget factors made
explicit.  Both results are pure order arithmetic on `ℝ≥0∞`; no analytic
hypothesis enters.

/-- The one-sided Morrey bound taken with the raw budget data is dominated by
the specialized constant `oneSidedPressureGradientKP`, whose budgets carry the
explicit factor `|C_CZ| + 1`. -/
