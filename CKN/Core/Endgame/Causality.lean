# Causality of the heat potential

Step 3 of the proof of `thm:A` splits every localized source at `t = 0`,
writing `F = F⁻ + F⁺` and `G_k = G_k⁻ + G_k⁺` with `F⁻ = 𝟏_{t ≤ 0} F`, and
observes that the positive-time kernel `W₊` annihilates the future part, so
that on `{t ≤ 0}` the localized velocity is the potential of the past part
alone. `heatPotential_time_truncation` is that statement in the equivalent
form used here: truncating the sources after a time does not change the
potential at or before that time. No integrability hypothesis is needed,
because the integrands agree pointwise, including at the boundary time.
Consequently the cut-offs of Step 3 may reach `{t > 0}`, as they must, since
the closure of the half cylinder contains its top face.
