# Topology of parabolic space-time

The parabolic metric of `CKN.Foundation.Parabolic.Basic` is obtained by pulling back the
product metric of `L²(ℝ³) × ℝ` (the time factor being snowflaked) along `parabolicMap`.
This file identifies the resulting topology with the product topology of the spatial
variable and time.  It is the bridge that lets openness and closure of the paper's
space-time carriers be read off from the corresponding statements on `Vec3 × ℝ`: in
particular the space-time set `def:sws`, whose carrier is `Ω × I`, is open for open `Ω`
and `I`, and the interior and closure of a parabolic cylinder are computed from the
Euclidean ball and the intervals `Ioo` and `Icc`.
