# Shifted kernels: measurability and separation

A kernel continuous away from the origin gives a measurable shifted integrand,
because the shifted singularity is a single point and hence a null set.  The
remaining lemmas record the reflection symmetry of the Euclidean length, the
fact that a small sup-norm displacement loses at most half of a Euclidean
separation, and the monotonicity of inverse powers.  These support the
potential estimates of `cor:CZ-harmonic`.

/-- The Euclidean length is symmetric under exchanging the two points.

This is the reflection symmetry used to convert the displacement `x - z`
appearing in the triangle inequality into the sup-norm difference `z - x` in
`half_le_vec3EuclideanNorm_sub`, part of the potential estimates of
`cor:CZ-harmonic`. -/

/-- A sup-norm displacement below `δ / 6` loses at most half of a Euclidean separation `δ`.

Writing `x - y = (x - z) + (z - y)` and applying the triangle inequality shows
that `vec3EuclideanNorm (z - y)` can fall short of `δ` by at most
`vec3EuclideanNorm (x - z)`, and the latter is bounded by `3 ‖z - x‖ < δ / 2`.
This is the geometric input to the potential estimates of `cor:CZ-harmonic`. -/

/-- Inverse powers reverse the order.

For `0 < δ ≤ t` and any exponent `n`, the inverse power `(t ^ n)⁻¹` is at most
`(δ ^ n)⁻¹`; this is the elementary monotonicity behind the all-order kernel
bounds of `cor:CZ-harmonic`. -/

/-- A kernel continuous away from the origin has a measurable shifted integrand.

The set `S = {y | y ≠ x}` is open and its complement is the singleton `{x}`,
which is null.  Hence `fun y => K (x - y)` is continuous on `S`, so almost
everywhere strongly measurable against `volume`, and the product with the
scalar factor `g` is measurable as well.  This is the measurability input to
the potential estimates of `cor:CZ-harmonic`. -/
