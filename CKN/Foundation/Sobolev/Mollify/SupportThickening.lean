# Support, mollifier support, and thickening lemmas

These five results were previously private lemmas in
`CKN/Foundation/Euclidean/RieszSecondExterior.lean` (the `d = 3` versions)
and `CKN/Foundation/Sobolev/Mollify/LpApproximation.lean` (the general `d`
version of `mollifier_tsupp_eq_closedBall`).  They are collected here as public
theorems.
