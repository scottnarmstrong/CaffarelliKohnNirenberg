# A quantitative smooth transition profile

This file records the one-dimensional profile used by the ball and space-time
cutoff constructions.

## Main definitions

* `CKN.smoothTransitionProfile`: the canonical smooth transition from `0` to
  `1`.
* `CKN.smoothTransitionProfile.derivBound`: its explicit first-derivative
  bound.

## Main results

* `smoothTransitionProfile.abs_deriv_le_eight`: the first derivative is
  bounded by `8`.
