# Translated mollifiers as spatial test functions

The slice form of a distributional identity is obtained by testing the
space-time identity against the countable family of mollifier bumps centred at
the points of a countable dense set.  This file records the elementary
properties of a single translated bump `x ↦ mollifier ε (x - y)`: it is smooth,
compactly supported with topological support the closed ball `closedBall y ε`,
and its coordinate derivative is the translate of the coordinate derivative of
the kernel.
