# Local integrability and continuity of translated-kernel integrals

Let `k` be a continuous kernel whose support lies in the closed ball of radius
`ε` about the origin, so that `k (· - y)` is supported in the closed ball of
radius `ε` about `y`. For a function `g` that is locally integrable on an open
set `Ω`, the product `x ↦ g x * k (x - y)` is then integrable as soon as the
ball `closedBall y ε` sits inside `Ω`, and the parametrised integral
`y ↦ ∫ x, g x * k (x - y)` is continuous wherever the translated ball still
fits inside `Ω`. These are the local-integrability and continuity inputs used
in the Caffarelli–Kohn–Nirenberg paper (CKN) when a spatially localised kernel
is slid against a locally integrable density.

/-- **Closed thickenings of a compact ball inside an open set.** If the closed
ball `closedBall y₀ ε` is contained in an open set `Ω`, then some positive
radius `δ` has the property that the closed `δ`-thickening of that ball is
still contained in `Ω`, and every translate of the ball whose centre lies
within distance `δ` of `y₀` is contained in that same thickening. This is the
uniform room around `closedBall y₀ ε` used in the Caffarelli–Kohn–Nirenberg
paper (CKN) to slide a localised kernel without leaving `Ω`. -/

/-- **Integrability of a translated kernel against a locally integrable
function.** If `k` is continuous and vanishes outside the closed ball of radius
`ε` about the origin, and `g` is locally integrable on `Ω`, then for any closed
ball `closedBall y ε` contained in `Ω` the product `x ↦ g x * k (x - y)` is
integrable for Lebesgue measure. This is the local-integrability input in the
Caffarelli–Kohn–Nirenberg paper (CKN) for a spatially localised kernel acted
against a locally integrable density. -/
